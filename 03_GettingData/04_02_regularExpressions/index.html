<h2>Regular expressions</h2>

<ul>
<li>Regular expressions can be thought of as a combination of literals and <em>metacharacters</em></li>
<li>To draw an analogy with natural language, think of literal text forming the words of this language, and the metacharacters defining its grammar</li>
<li>Regular expressions have a rich set of metacharacters</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h2>Literals</h2>

<p>Simplest pattern consists only of literals. The literal ???nuclear??? would match to the following lines:</p>

<pre><code class="markdown">Ooh. I just learned that to keep myself alive after a
nuclear blast! All I have to do is milk some rats
then drink the milk. Aweosme. :}

Laozi says nuclear weapons are mas macho

Chaos in a country that has nuclear weapons -- not good.

my nephew is trying to teach me nuclear physics, or
possibly just trying to show me how smart he is
so I???ll be proud of him [which I am].

lol if you ever say &quot;nuclear&quot; people immediately think
DEATH by radiation LOL
</code></pre>

<hr/>

<h2>Literals</h2>

<p>The literal ???Obama??? would match to the following lines</p>

<pre><code class="markdown">Politics r dum. Not 2 long ago Clinton was sayin Obama
was crap n now she sez vote 4 him n unite? WTF?
Screw em both + Mcain. Go Ron Paul!

Clinton conceeds to Obama but will her followers listen??

Are we sure Chelsea didn???t vote for Obama?

thinking ... Michelle Obama is terrific!

jetlag..no sleep...early mornig to starbux..Ms. Obama
was moving
</code></pre>

<hr/>

<h2>Regular Expressions</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Simplest pattern consists only of literals; a match occurs if the sequence of literals occurs anywhere in the text being tested</p></li>
<li><p>What if we only want the word ???Obama???? or sentences that end in the word ???Clinton???, or ???clinton??? or ???clinto????</p></li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h2>Regular Expressions</h2>

<p>We need a way to express </p>

<ul>
<li>whitespace word boundaries </li>
<li>sets of literals</li>
<li>the beginning and end of a line </li>
<li>alternatives (???war??? or ???peace???)
Metacharacters to the rescue!</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h2>Metacharacters</h2>

<p>Some metacharacters represent the start of a line</p>

<pre><code class="markdown">^i think
</code></pre>

<p>will match the lines</p>

<pre><code class="markdown">i think we all rule for participating
i think i have been outed
i think this will be quite fun actually
i think i need to go to work
i think i first saw zombo in 1999.
</code></pre>

<hr/>

<h2>Metacharacters</h2>

<p>$ represents the end of a line</p>

<pre><code class="markdown">morning$
</code></pre>

<p>will match the lines</p>

<pre><code class="markdown">well they had something this morning
then had to catch a tram home in the morning
dog obedience school in the morning
and yes happy birthday i forgot to say it earlier this morning
I walked in the rain this morning
good morning
</code></pre>

<hr/>

<h2>Character Classes with []</h2>

<p>We can list a set of characters we will accept at a given point in the match</p>

<pre><code class="markdown">[Bb][Uu][Ss][Hh]
</code></pre>

<p>will match the lines</p>

<pre><code class="markdown">The democrats are playing, &quot;Name the worst thing about Bush!&quot;
I smelled the desert creosote bush, brownies, BBQ chicken
BBQ and bushwalking at Molonglo Gorge
Bush TOLD you that North Korea is part of the Axis of Evil
I???m listening to Bush - Hurricane (Album Version)
</code></pre>

<hr/>

<h2>Character Classes with []</h2>

<pre><code class="markdown">^[Ii] am
</code></pre>

<p>will match</p>

<pre><code class="markdown">i am so angry at my boyfriend i can???t even bear to
look at him

i am boycotting the apple store

I am twittering from iPhone

I am a very vengeful person when you ruin my sweetheart.

I am so over this. I need food. Mmmm bacon...
</code></pre>

<hr/>

<h2>Character Classes with []</h2>

<p>Similarly, you can specify a range of letters [a-z] or [a-zA-Z]; notice that the order doesn???t matter</p>

<pre><code class="markdown">^[0-9][a-zA-Z]
</code></pre>

<p>will match the lines</p>

<pre><code class="markdown">7th inning stretch
2nd half soon to begin. OSU did just win something
3am - cant sleep - too hot still.. :(
5ft 7 sent from heaven
1st sign of starvagtion
</code></pre>

<hr/>

<h2>Character Classes with []</h2>

<p>When used at the beginning of a character class, the ???^??? is also a metacharacter and indicates matching characters NOT in the indicated class</p>

<pre><code class="markdown">[^?.]$
</code></pre>

<p>will match the lines</p>

<pre><code class="markdown">i like basketballs
6 and 9
dont worry... we all die anyway!
Not in Baghdad
helicopter under water? hmmm
</code></pre>
